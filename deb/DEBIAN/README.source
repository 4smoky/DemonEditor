Important:
    Terrestrial(DVB-T/T2) and cable(DVB-C) channels are only supported for Enigma2!
    Main supported *lamedb* format is version **4**. Versions **3** and **5** has only **experimental** support!
    For version **3** is only read mode available. When saving, version **4** format is used instead!

    When using the multiple import feature, from *lamedb* will be taken data **only for channels that are in the
    selected bouquets!** If you need full set of the data, including *[satellites, terrestrial, cables].xml* (current files will be overwritten),
    just load your data via *"File/Open"* and press *"Save"*. When importing separate bouquet files, only those services
    (excluding IPTV) that are in the **current open lamedb** (main list of services) will be imported.
